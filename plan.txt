The website should tell as well as demonstrate my skills, so maybe I could 
add a n body simulator as the background or make it interactive. 

I should add some parallax effect or dynamic (animated) background of some sort

Can have a projects section where there are interactive thumbnails of projects which could be clicked on 
to open that project's website or github

The website should always feel alive with a constantly evolving page or background effects

Technical:
I should use one of the big 3 frameworks especially if I want to join as a frontend developer (since companies
don't really need us to know svelte). However, building it on a new framework could also demonstrate our
enthusiasm for learning new things.

I don't like angular, so I have to choose between react.js and vue.js. I don't have any projects with vue.js currently
so maybe I should just go for that (since I also like vue more).
